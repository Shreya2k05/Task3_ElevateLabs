# Task 3: Responsive Layout with CSS Flexbox

This project focuses on creating a flexible, mobile-friendly personal profile using **CSS Flexbox**. It builds upon the semantic structure of Task 1 and the box model styling of Task 2 to deliver a modern, responsive user experience.

## 🚀 Key Learning Objectives
* Implementing `display: flex` on parent containers to enable flexible child layouts.
* Utilizing `justify-content` and `align-items` for precise element positioning.
* Applying `flex-wrap` to ensure content automatically adjusts to smaller screens.
* Testing responsiveness using **Browser DevTools** and device simulation.

## 🛠️ Features
* **Horizontal Navigation:** A flexible bar that adjusts its alignment based on screen width.
* **Responsive Project Cards:** A row-based layout of content cards that stacks vertically on mobile devices.
* **Mobile-First Alignment:** Use of media queries and flex properties to ensure readability on all devices.

## 🧪 Flexbox Properties Used
* `display: flex`: Established the flex context for containers.
* `flex-direction`: Controlled the primary axis of the layout.
* `justify-content`: Managed horizontal spacing (e.g., `space-around`, `center`).
* `align-items`: Handled vertical centering of elements.
* `flex-wrap: wrap`: Prevented overflow by moving items to the next line on small screens.

## 📂 How to Test
1. Open `index.html` in your browser.
2. Use the **Device Simulation** tool in DevTools (F12) to view the layout on various devices (iPhone, iPad, etc.).
3. Resize the window manually to observe the cards wrapping and the navigation adjusting.
